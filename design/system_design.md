We will implement a comprehensive mental health support platform using modern web technologies with a focus on user engagement, privacy, and scalability. The system will be built as a Progressive Web Application (PWA) with the following key implementation tasks:

Core Development Tasks
Frontend Development - React/Next.js application with TypeScript and Shadcn-ui components
Authentication System - Secure user management with privacy-first approach
Gamified Plant System - Interactive plant growth mechanics tied to user wellness activities
Community Platform - Forums, support circles, and peer-to-peer communication
Wellness Tools - Mood tracking, journaling, habit building, and mindfulness features
Real-time Features - WebSocket-based chat and live community updates
Animation System - Smooth plant growth animations and panda mascot interactions
Moderation & Safety - AI-powered content filtering and crisis support integration
Privacy & Security - GDPR-compliant data handling and user privacy controls
Mobile Optimization - Responsive design with PWA capabilities

4. UI Navigation Flow
The navigation system follows a hub-and-spoke model with the Dashboard as the central hub, ensuring users can access any feature within 2-3 clicks:

state "Dashboard" as Dashboard {
    Dashboard : Plant visualization
    Dashboard : Quick mood check-in
    Dashboard : Today's habits
    Dashboard : Community feed
}

state "Wellness Tools" as Wellness {
    state "Mood Tracker" as Mood
    state "Journal" as Journal
    state "Habits" as Habits
    state "Mindfulness" as Mindfulness
}

state "Community" as Community {
    state "Forums" as Forums
    state "Support Circles" as Circles
    state "Direct Messages" as DM
    state "Challenges" as Challenges
}

Dashboard --> Wellness : Access tools
Dashboard --> Community : View community
Dashboard --> Profile : User profile
Wellness --> Dashboard : Back home
Community --> Dashboard : Back home
Navigation Design Principles
Maximum 3-level depth: Prevents user confusion and maintains focus
Persistent crisis support: Emergency button accessible from every page
